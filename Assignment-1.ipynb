    "Q.1  who developed python programming language?\n",
    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1989.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.2  which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "Python supports several programming paradigms, including:\n",
    "    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n",
    "    Functional Programming\n",
    "    Procedural Programming\n",
    "Python design philosophy emphasizes code readability and a syntax which allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. This makes it a popular choice for developing a wide range of applications, from web applications to scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.3  Is python case sensitive when dealing identifiers?\n",
    "Yes, Python is case sensitive when dealing with identifiers (such as variable names, function names, etc.). This means that the names myVariable and myvariable are considered two different identifiers in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.4  What is the correct extension of python fie?\n",
    "The correct file extension for a Python file is .py. This extension used to indicate that a file contains Python code and can be executed by the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.5  Is python complied or interpreted?\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language. This means that the source code of a Python program is executed line by line, rather than being compiled into machine code. The Python interpreter reads the code and carries out the instructions, rather than producing a standalone executable file. This makes it easier and quicker to develop and test Python programs, but can also lead to slower performance compared to compiled languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.6  Name few block of code used to define in python language ?\n",
    "In Python, the following are the blocks of code used to define statements and structure the program:\n",
    "Functions: defined using the def keyword and are used to encapsulate a specific piece of logic.\n",
    "Classes: used to define custom data types and are the basis for object-oriented programming in Python.\n",
    "If-else statements: used to control the flow of a program based on whether certain conditions are met.\n",
    "For and while loops: used to repeat a set of operations multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.7  state the character used to give single comment in python?\n",
    "In Python, the character used to give a single line comment is #. Anything following the # symbol on a line will be ignored by the Python interpreter and will not be executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q.8  Mention the function which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "The function sys.version can be used to find the version of Python that you are currently working on. This will print the version information of the Python interpreter, including the version number, build information, and the compiler used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.9  Python the creation of anonymous function at runtime, using a construct called \"Lambda\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.10  What does pip stand for python?\n",
    "pip stands for \"Pip Installs Packages.\" It is the default package manager for Python and is used to install and manage packages and libraries that are not part of the Python standard library.\n",
    "Using pip, you can install, upgrade, and remove packages from the command line. For example:\n",
    "pip install package_name\n",
    "pip upgrade package_name\n",
    "pip uninstall package_name .\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.11  Mention few built-in function in python?\n",
    "Here are a few commonly used built-in functions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "print() - used to display output on the screen\n",
    "len() - returns the length of an object, such as a string, list, or tuple\n",
    "range() - generates a sequence of numbers\n",
    "int(), float(), str() - convert values to different data types\n",
    "type() - returns the type of an object.\n",
    "int(), float(), str() - convert values to different data types\n",
    "type() - returns the type of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.12  wWat is maximum possible length of an identifier in pyhton?\n",
    "In Python, there is no specific limit to the maximum length of an identifier. Typically, it is recommended to keep the length of an identifier between 1 and 31 characters, although it can be longer if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.13  What are benefit of using python?\n",
    "There are many benefits of using Python, some of the most notable are:\n",
    "      1.Easy to learn and read: Python has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy to learn and understand, even for non-programmers.\n",
    "      2.Versatile and multi-purpose: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "      3.Large standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that provides many useful functions and modules, saving developers time and effort by not having to build everything from scratch.\n",
    "      4.Dynamic typing: Python supports dynamic typing, which allows for faster development, as well as more flexible and easier-to-maintain code.\n",
    "      5.Cross-platform compatibility: Python can run on a variety of operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it a highly portable language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.14  How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "Memory in Python is managed automatically by the Python memory manager, which is a part of the Python runtime system. The memory manager is responsible for allocating and freeing memory, as well as managing the size of the memory pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.15  how to install python on window and set path variable?\n",
    "Here are the steps to install Python on Windows and set the PATH environment variable:\n",
    "     1.Download the Python installer from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "     2.Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to select the option to add Python to the PATH environment variable during the installation process.\n",
    "     3.Open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\".\n",
    "     4.Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n",
    "     5.Click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "     6.Under \"System Variables\", scroll down to find the \"Path\" variable, then click on it and click the \"Edit\" button.\n",
    "     7.Click the \"New\" button and add the path to the Python executable, typically \"C:\\PythonXX\\python.exe\", where XX is the version number of Python you have installed.\n",
    "     8.Click \"OK\" to save the changes and close all the windows.\n",
    "     9.Open the Command Prompt and type \"python\" to confirm that Python has been successfully installed and the PATH variable has been set.\n",
    "   This will allow you to run Python from anywhere in the command line by simply typing \"python\". You can also use other Python tools, such as pip, in the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q.16  Is indentation required in python?\n",
    "Yes, indentation is required in Python. It is used to define blocks of code, such as loops, functions, and control structures. The number of spaces or tabs used for indentation is up to the programmer, but it must be consistent within a block. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "  for i in range(10):\n",
    "      print(i)\n",
    "      \n",
    "  In this example, the print statement is indented four spaces from the left margin, indicating that it is part of the for loop. This indentation makes the code easier to read and understand, and it is a key feature of the Python programming language.\n",
